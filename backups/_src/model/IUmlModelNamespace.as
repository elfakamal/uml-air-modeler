	 * A namespace is a named element that can own other named elements. 
	 * Each named element may be owned by at most one namespace. 
	 * A namespace provides a means for identifying named elements by name. 
	 * Named elements can be identified by name in a namespace either 
	 * by being directly owned by the namespace or by being introduced 
	 * into the namespace by other means (e.g., importing or inheriting). 
	 * 
	 * A namespace can own constraints. A constraint associated with 
	 * a namespace may either apply to the namespace itself, or it may 
	 * apply to elements in the namespace.
	 * 
	 * A namespace has the ability to import either individual members 
	 * or all members of a package, thereby making it possible to refer 
	 * to those named elements without qualification in the importing namespace. 
	 * In the case of conflicts, it is necessary to use qualified names 
	 * or aliases to disambiguate the referenced elementsA namespace 
	 * is a named element that can own other named elements.
